    expected answers that serve as scoring benchmarks. Use the expected_keywords,
    difficulty, topic, and qaPairs from {interview_data}.\n\nEach expected answer
    should include:\n\n1. **Core Technical Concepts** - Key terms from {interview_data}
    expected_keywords and technical principles\n2. **Practical Examples** - Real-world
    applications matching {interview_data} difficulty level  \n3. **Professional Communication**
    - Clear structure and appropriate depth for {interview_data} topic\n4. **Keyword

    SCORING POLICY:** ENFORCE EXACT SCORING CONSTRAINTS WITH ZERO FLEXIBILITY. MANDATORY
    SCORE RANGES (NO EXCEPTIONS): 0–9: Response completely unrelated to question,
    no expected keywords, total lack of understanding. 10–29: Extremely poor or off-track,
    random terms, no conceptual correctness. 30–45: Vague or wrong with misconceptions.
    46–55: Surface awareness but lacks technical accuracy. 56–65: Basic understanding
    but incomplete. 66–75: Solid understanding, minor gaps. 76–85: Strong technical
    accuracy with expected keywords. 86–100: Exceptional mastery and precision.\n\n**EVALUATION
    METHOD:** Compare each candidate answer against the expected answers using {interview_data}
    for expected_keywords, difficulty, topic, and qaPairs. Check for:\n\n1. **Expected
    Keywords Usage** - How many relevant expected_keywords from {interview_data} are
    properly used\n2. **Technical Accuracy** - Correctness compared to expected answer\n3.
    **Concept Understanding** - Depth of knowledge demonstrated\n4. **Communication
    Quality** - Professional articulation for {interview_data} topic at difficulty
    level\n\n**EXACT SCORING RANGES (STRICTLY ENFORCED):**\n\n**0–9: Complete Failure**\n-
    Dismissive responses: \"Yeah\", \"Yep\", \"Yeah. Let's continue\"\n- Zero expected
    keywords used appropriately\n- Completely unrelated or nonsensical answers\n-
    No technical engagement whatsoever\n\n**10–29: Extremely Poor** \n- Shows question
    was heard but provides wrong/irrelevant information\n- Random technical terms
    without understanding\n- Major misconceptions about basic concepts\n\n**30–45:
    Poor with Misconceptions**\n- Mentions some relevant terms but with significant
    errors\n- Basic awareness but lacks accuracy (e.g., \"ENP\" instead of \"NumPy\")\n-
    Confused or incomplete explanations\n\n**46–55: Surface Level**\n- Uses some expected
    keywords but superficially\n- Technically correct but lacks depth or precision\n-
    Missing important details for difficulty level\n\n**56–65: Basic Understanding**\n-
    Covers key concepts with minor gaps\n- Uses several expected keywords appropriately\n-
    Good structure but could be more comprehensive\n\n**66–75: Solid Performance**\n-
    Strong use of expected keywords\n- Demonstrates clear technical understanding\n-
    Professional communication with good depth\n\n**76–85: Strong Performance**\n-
    Comprehensive coverage using most relevant expected keywords\n- Matches expected
    answer quality closely\n- Shows practical understanding and application\n\n**86–100:
    Exceptional**\n- Exceeds expected answer quality\n- Natural integration of all
    relevant expected keywords\n- Advanced insights beyond basic requirements\n\n**MANDATORY
    EVALUATION PROCESS:**\n1. Quote candidate's exact response\n2. Compare against
    expected answer\n3. Count expected keywords from {interview_data} used correctly\n4.
    Identify technical accuracy level\n5. Assign score within appropriate range\n6.
